\emph{Abstract} -- 
The purpose of this project was to create an environment -- using \texttt{Unity} -- where vehicules execute cooperativly search and pursuit of intruders. The problem involves optimising different algorithms such as discretizing an environment, computing a minimal path for a fleet of vehicule that are to survey a given area, optimizing the search of a mobile intruder, pursuiting and capturing an intruder.

In this paper we focus on three different problems. The first is how to find the position of static guards such that a given set of building is completly guard. The second problem is how to clean a area with moving guard -- \emph{i.e.} every part of the area has been seen. The third problem is how to search and capture a moving intruder that is trying to escape.
