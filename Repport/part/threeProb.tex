Our work was divided into three main problems, even if we tried to keep a high level of generality in order to use as much as possible the different algorithm in the three of them.

\begin{problem}[Static Guarding]
Given an environment, find a set of points $P_{1\leq i \leq n}$ such that every free point in the environment is visible from a least one $P_i$, with $n$ as small as possible. This problem is also known as the art gallery problem.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}[Dynamic Guarding]
Given an environment, find paths for $n$ robot ($n$ is a parameter) in order to clear the whole area, \emph{i.e} each point in the environment has been seen.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}[Search \& Capture]
Given an environment, find paths for $n$ robot ($n$ as small as possible) in order to find a moving intruder. Once it is located, pursue and capture it.
\end{problem}
