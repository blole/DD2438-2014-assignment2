Our work was divided into three main problems, even if we tried to keep a high level of generality in order to use as much as possible the different algorithm in the three of them.

\begin{problem}[Static Guarding]
Given an area with obstacles, find a set of point $P_{1\leq i \leq n}$ such as every free point of the area is seen from a least one $P_i$, with $n$ as small as possible. It is also referred as the art gallery problem.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}[Dynamic Guarding]
Given an area with obstacles, find paths for $n$ robot ($n$ is a parameter) in order to clear the whole area (\emph{i.e} Each point of the area has been seen).
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}[Search \& Capture]
Given an area, find paths for $n$ robot ($n$ as small as possible) in order to find a moving intruder. Once it is located, pursue him in order to capture him.
\end{problem}
