The problem of dynamic guarding we approach by first solving the static guarding problem, giving us a set of points that are sufficient for surveiling the whole environment.
All we have to do now is visit all of these points with at least one guard, this is the Vehicle Routing Problem, VRP.

This may not yield an optimal solution, but a solution none the less.
