We have in this report described how we solved the problems of finding a static surveillance (the art gallery problem) and finding patrol paths for moving guards looking for immobile intruders.
We have also given an idea for an algorithm to secure an environment while the intruders are moving around.

None of our solutions are guaranteed to be optimal, but visual inspection suggests them to be quite good.
